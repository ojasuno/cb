title: Cyber Brokers Gallery
---

We find ourselves drawn & lost in the amazing craft + storyline of Cyber Brokers (CB).

Every so often, we are in awe with the CBs we own and begin to appreciate the depth of each element that makes up the NFT.

...Elements...
- text
- circle
- rect
- line
- path
- textPath
- polygon
- g

And so my quest to catalogue, each and every CB begins here.

This project intends to create a gallery for the **10001** CBs and welcome you the owner of 1..n CBs to admire, learn, document, your experience and share the endless possibilities you choose to explore with your CB In Real Life (IRL), In Meta Verse (IMV).

Who knows, your being, your thoughts, your writing, your actions ...may inspire the past, the present, and the future generations.

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}> {children} </span> );

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
